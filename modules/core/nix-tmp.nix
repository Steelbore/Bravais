# Spacecraft Software Bravais — Loop-mounted /mnt/nix-tmp for Nix builder TMPDIR
#
# Move Nix's working set off the system disk and onto a 40 GiB ext4
# loop image on the user's Expansion external drive. udisks2 mounts
# the drive at /run/media/mj/Expansion after login (no UUID-based
# fileSystems entry available — the drive is removable). A systemd
# path unit watches that directory; when it appears, a oneshot
# service creates the .img if missing, mkfs.ext4's it, mounts it
# loop-back at /mnt/nix-tmp, and chmods 1777.
#
# nix-daemon's TMPDIR is set to /mnt/nix-tmp unconditionally. With
# the drive unplugged, /mnt/nix-tmp is the empty local tmpfiles dir
# and builds fall back to the system disk transparently. With the
# drive plugged in, the same path resolves to the loop ext4.
#
# Mode is 0755 root:root (NOT 1777). Nix 2.31+ refuses a world-writable
# `build-dir` for security; only nix-daemon (root) needs to write here,
# and it creates per-build subdirs as the nixbld* sandbox users itself.
# This dir is *not* a user-level TMPDIR.

  # Sparse, so the .img only consumes what builds actually write.
