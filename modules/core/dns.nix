# Spacecraft Software Bravais — DNS via systemd-resolved with DoT + DNSSEC
#
# Primary  : Cloudflare malware-block (1.1.1.2 / 1.0.0.2, SNI
#            security.cloudflare-dns.com). Drops queries for known
#            malicious domains at the DNS level.
# Fallback : regular Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1, SNI
#            cloudflare-dns.com). Used only when primary is
#            unreachable; keeps DoT and DNSSEC, loses malware
#            filtering during fallback.
#
# All queries are encrypted in transit (DoT, port 853) and
# DNSSEC-validated end-to-end. The `~.` routing domain makes the
# global DNS the route for every query, ignoring any link-specific
# DNS pushed by DHCP from the LAN gateway.
#
# Schema note: on nixos-unstable, `services.resolved.{dnssec,
# dnsovertls,domains,fallbackDns}` were renamed to
# `services.resolved.settings.Resolve.{DNSSEC,DNSOverTLS,Domains,
# FallbackDNS}`. The old names still work via mkRenamedOptionModule
# but emit deprecation warnings. On stable 25.11 only the old names
# exist. The `options.services.resolved ? settings` check picks the
# right form per channel — same stable/unstable workaround pattern
# as CLAUDE.md known constraint #5.
