# Spacecraft Software Bravais — System-Wide Dark Mode (Niri + LeftWM)
#
# Provides the system-level plumbing for an always-on dark GTK/Qt theme
# under bare WM sessions (Niri, LeftWM) where no DE control center is
# present to drive xdg-desktop-portal-gtk's appearance interface or to
# set gsettings keys.
#
# Per-user theme selection (gtk.*, qt.*, home.pointerCursor) lives in
# users/mj/home.nix — this module only ships the packages, enables
# dconf, and routes the portal so the HM layer's dconf writes are
# visible to xdg-desktop-portal-gtk.
#
# DE sessions (GNOME, COSMIC, Plasma) are deliberately untouched — they
# carry their own appearance controllers; the dconf keys this module's
# HM counterpart writes only take effect when those DEs' own theme
# system is not overriding (i.e. under Niri / LeftWM).

  # explicitly so it's present even with GNOME disabled.
  #
  # Routing notes:
  # - niri: upstream `services.programs.wayland.niri` already sets
  #   `xdg.portal.config.niri.default = "gnome;gtk"` — an ordered
  #   fallback. Both -gnome and -gtk read color-scheme from the same
  #   `org.gnome.desktop.interface.color-scheme` dconf key, so leaving
  #   that default alone gives correct dark-mode behavior. Setting our
  #   own value here would conflict at eval time.
  # - leftwm: not in nixpkgs (we ship our own xsession), so no upstream
  #   default. Set explicitly to the gtk backend.
